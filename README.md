# hello-world
A simple repo to introduce myself and the TheMC project.

TheMC (i.e. The Maker Community) is the trademark brand name for our non-profit charity venture to support Makers and the Maker Community.

Our home on the net is <a href="https://themc.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">themc.network</a>, under initial development from 12/2021 to (estimated) 04/2022. 

I am known to some as <a href="https://linuxarchitect.themc.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinuxArchitect</a>, CowProtector, and MakerGeorge. <-- links to my "CV" for each as I develop my new sites on themc.network.
